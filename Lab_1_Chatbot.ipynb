    "You will first create a simple interactive loop between user input and program output. Before entering the loop, your program should prompt the user to request their input (e.g. \"Hi, how can I help you?\"). At each iteration of the loop, the program should take user input (typed onto the terminal pressing 'Enter' at the end) and then output simple statistical information about that input (e.g. \"You entered X letters and Y words\"). Also add a way to exit the loop; for example, if the user types \"Bye\" the loop should end and your program should halt after a final prompt to the user to acknowledge that the interaction has ended. Add your code below."

    "Next you will upgrade your chatbot to be a \"good listener.\" Do not worry about deleting or overwriting things you did in the previous step. Before entering into the interactive loop, your chatbot should ask the user's name and remember it throughout the chat. It should also prompt the user to talk about something (e.g. \"How was your day, Ashitaka?\") As part of the loop, the chatbot should analyze the user's input and decide whether to give a positive, negative, or neutral response. To analyze the input, we have supplied a fixed list of [positive](http://ptrckprry.com/course/ssd/data/positive-words.txt) and [negative](http://ptrckprry.com/course/ssd/data/negative-words.txt) words and which will determine the number of positive and negative words that occur in the user's input. For the most simple version of the `ListenBot`, your list of positive and negative words do not have to be too long, just enough to showcase a simple conversation. However, the lists we supply will make your `ListenBot` more robust. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot should respond based on the number of positive and negative words in the user's input. Your chatbot should have at least two different responses of each type and should alternate between responses, e.g.:\n",
    "* Positive responses: \"Great!\" \"Cool!\"\n",
    "* Negative responses: \"Too bad!\" \"Womp, womp!\"\n",
    "* Neutral responses: \"Hmm..\" \"I see.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, there should be at least one way to end the conversation. You can make the ways to end the conversation known to the user in your earlier prompt or somewhere during the conversation. Add your updated code below."
